PROJECT TITLE: Clain Academy Challenge
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Prerequisite for Techincal Interview
VERSION or DATE: 2016.03.06
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Choose a class based on the output you require.
AUTHORS: Jerry Johnson
SCOPE OF PROGRAMS:

Check for Odd or Even
        declare a variable equal to 3. Be prepared to change this variable value during your interview.
        come up with a program that checks if that variable is odd or even, and prints out "Odd" or "Even" to the console
Check for divisibility by 3 or 5
        using the same variable from the first part of the challenge, check to see if that variable is divisible by 3, 5, or both.
        print to the console "Divisible by 3", "Divisible by 5", "Divisible by both 3 and 5", or "Indivisible by 3 or 5" as appropriate for each evaluation.
Change numbers
        using the output from the last part of the problem, output a new string where every number is changed into its written form (e.g. "3" becomes "three"), unless...
        ...unless the result is that the number evaluated is indivisible by 3 or 5, in which case, change the output string to "Indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for All"
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000
        For your final test, come up with a program that prints out the value of the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
